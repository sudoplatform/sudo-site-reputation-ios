  `UNKNOWN` is intentionally missing from this enum, though it exists on the service other and SDK's.
  This is because graphQL codegen for swift will automatically add a `unknown(String)` case which conflicts
  with the one which would be here. I breifly looked for a way to disable this behavior,
  but removing seemed the simplest.
